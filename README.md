# Video-File-List
This Powershell script will search and list all video/movie files on the specified drive in order from biggest to smallest and the size they take up on the drive
 
To use this script open powershell run as administrator click on the File Finder.txt copy the script to clipboard by clicking at the top of the page starting at the first letter and using ctrl+c and paste using ctrl+v and then hit enter

I have used drive "D" for this script but you can change it to what ever drive you need by looking through the script and changing where you see drive "d" mentioned in the scipt if you do this you will also need also change "$outputDir = "D:\Video File Lists"" thats where the output file goes when script is completed
